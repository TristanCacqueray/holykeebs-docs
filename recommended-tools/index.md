# Recommended Tools

Before you start your keyboard building journey, a few tools are required.

At a minimum you will need the tools listed in the [Keyboard Build Guide](../guides/keyboard/index.md#tools). This page goes into more detail with a few recommendations.

## Soldering Iron

- Pinecil v2 is one of the best budget soldering irons on the market.
- If you see yourself doing more soldering in the future and willing to invest >$100, consider the Aixun T3A. Even though it's Chinese, the build quality and materials used are very impressive for the price. Having used Hakko stations for years, I can confidently say that this station is far better in terms of value.

## Desoldering

I find soldering wick to be the best common denominator here. A solder sucker is also a good tool to have, but if you're only getting one, get the wick.

## Tweezers

Get both a pointy one and an angled one, they are both useful.

## Pliers

These are great for straightening bent pins.

## Flush Cutters

Sharp and thin at the cutting edge is best.

## Screwdriver

These (knock off?) Stanley screwdrivers get the job done. The end can wear out after many uses though (can be fixed by sanding it).

If you need a screwdriver set for other things, get the iFixit kit.
