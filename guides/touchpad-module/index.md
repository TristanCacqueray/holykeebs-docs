# Touchpad Module

The touchpad module consists of a small adapter PCB (shield) that sits on a top mounted controller, and creates the necessary connections to easily use the Cirque 35mm touchpad.

## Tools

In addition to a soldering iron, you will need an M2 hex key and a bit of super glue.

## Controller

See the [Controllers section](/guides/keyboard/#controllers) in the more general purpose keyboard build guide.

If you have an existing controller, skip this step.

## Module

The module comes with the following parts:

- 35mm touchpad
- adapter PCB (either left or right sided)
- 20-30 mm 12-pin, 0.5 pitch FFC cable
- 3d printed mount
- 2 x M2 screws to fasten mount to adapter PCB

First, we solder the adapter PCB to the controller.
