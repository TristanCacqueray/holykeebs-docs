# Keyball

Keyball is a family of keyboards that feature a 34mm thumb trackball with the widely used PMW3360 sensor. In partnership with Yowkees of Shirogane Lab, the creator of this wonderful integrated trackball design, we're happy to bring Keyball to a wider audience.

The trackball sits in an injected molded housing with 3 ceramic bearings. The ball slides snuggly into the housing and moves smoothly in all directions thanks to the bearings.

## Buyer's Guide

Most of the general purpose [Buyer's Guide](../../buyers-guide/index.md) applies to Keyball lineup of keyboards as well, it stands out in a few ways described below.

First, it's worth noting that our Keyball differ from the one sold by Yushakobo / Shirogane Lab. In terms of cosmetics, we use black PCBs, different thickness acrylic plates and different M2 screws. Additionally, we use Sea-Picro. The rest is identical.

### 34mm Trackball

Keyball uses a 34mm trackball that's not included in your purchase. There are many color options to choose from, and the ones made by [Perixx are a popular choice](https://www.amazon.com/Perixx-PERIPRO-303-GLG-Trackball-Compatible/dp/B07BDHK2MR).

### Thumb Cluster

Keyball has a unique thumb cluster that allows either Kailh's choc low profile or MX switches. Whether you're buying a kit or a prebuilt one, you will get choc hotswap sockets. This option lets you also add choc switches and keycaps to your order.
